
The website I visited using the Way Back Machine was twitch.tv. The page i veiwed was from July of 2011. I was very surprised at how different it looked. The design was a lot more basic. There was a simple white background with links to different game categories. This is much different from the more developed current version which now has a follow list, spotlited streamers as well as reccomended streamers. I also noticed there were almost no advertisements on the oloder version.
