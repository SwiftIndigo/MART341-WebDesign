    Missoula is one of my favorite places in the world. It has given me opportunites that I am very thankful for. The beautiful nature and the lively artistic scene has provided a lot of inspiration for music production.

    Friends I've Made
</h2>

<p>I have have been very fortunate to be able to meet and colaborate with several other local artists. The comradery that has been formed between new friends that I have made through music is priceless. A few mentions to these amazing local artists. "Thin Truk", "Fish Bwoi", McMoney and Defcat are just a few. There are many more and I hope to be continuing building these types of relationships!</p>
